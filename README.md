# todo

* Hello, I do not recommend using this Todo CLI Tool.
* This guy's code is afwul.
* Don't even dare to consider this app as an example of building APIs, cause I built this only for me, so It's small, It's working, but code is so bad, that you better get out of this repo page.
* If you still want to use it, git clone it and build using go, cause this app is so badly written, that I'm not gonna give you an opportunity to go install it, hehe <3

## If you want to use it (What's wrong with you?):
  1. set `LOS_TODOS_HERMANOS` - it is a path to `config.yaml` file.
  2. specify `DSN` or path to SQLite DB file in `config.yaml` file.
  3. move executable into a folder specified in the env.
  4. Done.
